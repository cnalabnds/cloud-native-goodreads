## Introduction
**Cloud native goodreads** is a curated list of publicly available resources on how companies around the world should practice **DevOps** - CI/CD

There are many ways to practice DevOps. Fortunately, many companies are willing to share how they do it. I believe there is much to learn from this documented use cases and published resources. The content you’ll find in this repository is a list of such resources.

The reosources are indexed by companies, technologies, years and DevOps related topics

Happy Learning!
